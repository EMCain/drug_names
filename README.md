# Drug Names

Python program to generate pharmaceutical advertisements for fictional drugs

Drug names based on a Markov chain fed by this [list of drug names](https://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/drug/names/a)

## to use:

you can run any of the files containing if __name__ == '__main__', including: 

  [Drug Names](https://github.com/EMCain/drug_names/blob/b6c5563945014a5cad72e37f1aee5e934c094c2f/drug_name.py)

  [Generate Advertisement](https://github.com/EMCain/drug_names/blob/b6c5563945014a5cad72e37f1aee5e934c094c2f/generate_advertisement.py)

  [Generate Disease](https://github.com/EMCain/drug_names/blob/b6c5563945014a5cad72e37f1aee5e934c094c2f/generate_disease.py)

from the command line to print the results.

set up your virtualenv with Python 3

`$ pip install -r requirements.text`

use `drug_name.create_drug_name` to get a medication name, or `generate_advertisement.get_ad` for a full advertisement.

You could regenerate names.txt (list of real drug names) or chain.p if you wanted to, but you don't have to.
