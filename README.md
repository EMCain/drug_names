# Drug Names

a Python script to generate medication names

based on a Markov chain fed by this [list of drug names](https://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/drug/names/a)

to use:

set up your virtualenv with Python 3
`$ pip install -r requirements.text`
`$ python drug_name.py`

You could regenerate names.txt (list of real drug names) or chain.p if you wanted to, but you don't have to.
